# The pillars of a floating license system

Floating licensing is a software licensing model that allows multiple users to share a limited number of software licenses, often referred to as "seats" or "concurrent licenses" on a dynamic, as-needed basis.

## License Pool

In a floating license system, there is a central license pool that contains a predefined number of available licenses for a particular software application. These licenses are not tied to specific users or devices.

## User Requests

When a user wants to use the software, they initiate a request for a license from the central license pool. This request typically happens automatically when they launch the software.

## License Checkout

If a license is available in the pool at the time of the user's request, it is "checked out" or temporarily assigned to that user. This allows the user to use the software for a specified period, typically for the duration of their session.

## Concurrent Usage

The total number of available licenses dictates how many users can simultaneously use the software. For example, if you have ten floating licenses, up to ten users can use the software concurrently. When all licenses are in use, additional users will have to wait or be denied access until a license becomes available. permitted.io not only supports this requirement, but also it allows more than one coneection or session per user if defined in the license pool rules.

## Automatic License Release

When a user finishes their session or exits the software, the license they were using is automatically released back into the license pool. This makes it available for other users to check out. permitted.io's real-time seat tracking capability allows the licenses to be released without latency.

## License Management

To ensure fairness and prevent overuse, floating license systems often include license management software. This software keeps track of which licenses are in use, monitors license utilization, and may provide reporting and auditing capabilities. permitted.io's web portal provides an intuitive user experience to manage licenses.

## License Expiry

Some floating license systems may also have a feature that automatically releases a license after a set period of inactivity or based on a time limit. This ensures efficient use of licenses, especially in cases where users forget to release licenses after they finish using the software [^1].

[^1]: This feature is currently under analysis to implement.

# The Benefits of a Floating License

Floating licenses offer several benefits for both software providers and users. Here are some of the key advantages of using a floating license model:

## Cost Efficiency

Software providers can reduce the total number of licenses they need to distribute since licenses are shared among users. This can lead to significant cost savings. Users can also benefit from cost savings, as they only need to purchase licenses for the maximum number of concurrent users they anticipate.

## Optimized Resource Utilization

Floating licenses allow for the efficient use of software licenses. Licenses are dynamically allocated to users as needed, reducing the likelihood of unused licenses. Users can access software when required, without waiting for additional licenses to become available.

## Scalability

Organizations can easily scale their software usage up or down by adjusting the number of floating licenses they own. This flexibility accommodates changing user needs.

## Reduced Administrative Overhead

Managing a smaller pool of floating licenses is often less administratively burdensome than tracking individual, named user licenses. Users don't need to worry about managing or transferring licenses between devices or users.

## Improved Collaboration

Floating licenses facilitate collaboration by allowing multiple team members to access and use the software simultaneously. This enhances productivity and teamwork.

## Compliance and Control

Software providers can enforce compliance by controlling the number of concurrent users and ensuring that only authorized users have access. Users can better manage their licenses and ensure they are not overusing or underusing them.

## Enhanced Flexibility

Users can access the software from various locations and devices as long as licenses are available, making it suitable for remote work and diverse IT environments.

## Adaptability for Seasonal Demands

Industries with seasonal fluctuations can benefit from floating licenses by adjusting license counts to meet peak demands during busy seasons and reducing them during slower periods. 

Overall, floating licenses provide a more efficient and cost-effective way for organizations to manage their software licenses while ensuring that users have access to the software they need when they need it.

# Traditional floating licensing with on-premise license servers vs permitted.io

## The traditional way

Traditional floating licensing with on-premise license servers is a licensing model commonly used for software distribution in on-premises or local network environments. In this model, the software licenses are managed and distributed from a central server located within the organization's own physical infrastructure. 

One limitation of traditional floating licensing with on-premise license servers is that users must be connected to the organization's network to access the licenses. This can be a drawback for remote or off-site users. Overall, traditional floating licensing with on-premise license servers offers organizations a way to efficiently manage software licenses within their own infrastructure, control access, and optimize license utilization. However, it may not be as flexible for remote or distributed teams compared to cloud-based or hosted license server solutions.

## The modern floating license approach offered by permitted.io

On-cloud floating licensing platforms, also known as cloud-based or hosted floating licensing systems, offer a modern and flexible approach to managing software licenses. This eliminates the need for organizations to maintain their own on-premises license servers. These platforms are highly scalable, allowing organizations to easily add or reduce the number of licenses as their needs change. This flexibility is particularly valuable for growing businesses. 

Users can access software licenses hosted in the cloud from anywhere with an internet connection. This makes it suitable for remote or distributed teams and allows for seamless access to software resources. Cloud-based floating licensing platforms typically offer robust security measures to protect software licenses and user data. They often include features like encryption, authentication, and access controls. The cloud service provider typically handles software updates and maintenance, ensuring that the licensing platform is up-to-date and reliable.

Overall, permitted.io as a cloud-based floating licensing platform offers the benefits of traditional floating licensing while providing the flexibility, accessibility, and scalability of cloud-based solutions. It is particularly well-suited for modern, distributed work environments and businesses looking to streamline their license management processes.
